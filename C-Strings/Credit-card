A Credit Card number is usually a 16-digit number. A valid Credit Card number would satisfy a rule explained below with the help of a dummy Credit Card number - 
4567 1234 5678 9129.
Start with the rightmost - 1 digit and multiply every other digit by 2.
4 5 6 7  1 2 3 4  5 6 7 8  9 1 2 9
8 12     2  6     10  14   18  4
Then subtracct 9 from any number larger than 10.
Thus we get:
8 3 2 6 1 5 9 4
Add them all up to get 38.
Add all the other digits to get 42.
Sum of 38 and 2 is 80. Since 80 is divisible by 10, the credit card number is valid.
Write a program that recieves a Credit card number and checks using the above rule whether the Credit card number is valid.


#include<stdio.h>
#include<conio.h>
int main()
{
	char num[20];
	int i, sum = 0;
	printf("\nEnter the 16 digit credit card number : ");
	scanf("%s", num);

	for (i = 0; i <= 15; i++)//Traversing all numbers
	{
		num[i] -= 48;//converting each character in numeral
		if ((i % 2))//if the number is on right so it will directly get summed
			sum = sum + num[i];
		else//if number is on left, so it will first get doubled
		{
			num[i] *= 2;
			if (num[i] >= 10)//if number is greater then or equal to 10 so it will subtracted from 9
				num[i] -= 9;
			sum = sum + num[i];	//summing number
		}
	}
	if (!(sum % 10))//if sum is divisble by 10 so number is valid
		printf("\nNumber is valid.");
	else
		printf("\nNumber is not valid.");
	_getch();
	return 0;
}
