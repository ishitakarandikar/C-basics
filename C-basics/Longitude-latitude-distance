Write a C program to receive values of latitude(L1,L2) and longitude(G1,G2), in degrees, of two places on the earth and output the distance(D) between then in nautical miles. 
The formula for distance in nautical miles is here
D= 3963 cos^-1(sinL1sinL2 + cosL1cosL2 * cos(G2-G1))

#include<stdio.h>
#include<conio.h>
#include<math.h>
int main()
{
    float L1, L2, G1, G2, distance, distance_km, distance_nm, dL, dG;

    //input two points (place) location (latitude and longitude) in degree form
    printf("Enter the co-ordinate of first place: ");
    scanf("%f %f", &L1, &G1);

    printf("Enter the co-ordinate of second place: ");
    scanf("%f %f", &L2, &G2);

    //find out the distance between two end points using formulla
    dL = L2-L1;
    dG = G2-G1;
    distance = sqrt((dL*dL)+(dG)*(dG));
    distance_km = distance*100;

    printf("The distance between two place in kilometer: %.2f", distance_km);

    //comvert kilometer into nautical miles
    distance_nm = distance_km/1.852;

    printf("\nThe distance between two place in nautical miles: %.2f", distance_nm);

    return 0;
}
