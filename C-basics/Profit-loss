If cost price and selling price of an item are input through the keyboard, write a C program to determine whether the seller has made profit or incured loss.
Also determine how much profit he made or loss he incurred.

#include <stdio.h>  
   
int main() {  
    int costPrice, sellingPrice; 
       
    /* 
     * Take costPrice and SellingPrice as input from user 
     */ 
    printf("Enter Cost Price and Selling Price\n");  
    scanf("%d %d", &costPrice, &sellingPrice);
       
    if(costPrice > sellingPrice) {
        /* Loss */   
        printf("Loss = %d\n", costPrice - sellingPrice);  
    } else if(sellingPrice > costPrice) {  
        /* Profit or Gain*/ 
        printf("Profit = %d\n", sellingPrice - costPrice);  
    } else {
     /* No Profit or Loss*/
        printf("No Profit and No Loss\n");  
    }  
   
    return 0;  
}
