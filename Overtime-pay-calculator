Write a program to calculate overtime pay of 10 employees. Overtime is paid at the rate of Rs. 12.00 per hour for every hour worked above 40 hours. 
Assume that employees do not work for fractional part of an hour.

#include<stdio.h>
#include<conio.h>
int main()
{
    int count = 1, working_hours, over_time;
    float over_time_pay;

    while(count<=10)
    {
        printf("Enter the working hours of employee no %d: ", count);
        scanf("%d", &working_hours);
        if(working_hours>40)
        {
            over_time = working_hours - 40;
            over_time_pay = over_time * 12.00;
            printf("Employee No %d overtime pay is %.2f\n", count, over_time_pay);
        }
        else
            printf("You have to work for more than 40 hours to get over time pay\n");

        count++;
    }
}
