Write a program to find the grace marks for a student using switch. The user should enter the class obtained by the student and the number of students he has failed in.
Use the following logic: – 

If the student gets first class and the number of subjects he failed in is greater than 3, then he does not get any grace. Otherwise the grace is of 5 marks per subject.
– If the student gets second class and the number of subjects he failed in is greater than 2, then he does not get any grace. Otherwise the grace is of 4 marks per subject. 
– If the student gets third class and the number of subjects he failed in is greater than 1, then he does not get any grace. Otherwise the grace is of 5 marks.

#include<stdio.h>
#include<conio.h>
int main()
{
    int div, sub;

    printf("Enter the class obtained by the student: ");
    scanf("%d", &div);

    printf("Enter the number of subject in which he has failed: ");
    scanf("%d", &sub);

    switch(div)
    {
        //for first class students
        case 1:
            if(sub<=3)
                printf("He got the grace of %d marks",5*sub);
            else
                printf("He didn't get any grace");
        break;

        //for second class student
        case 2:
            if(sub<=2)
                printf("He got the grace of %d marks",4*sub);
            else
                printf("He didn't get any grace");
        break;

        case 3:
            if(sub<=1)
                printf("He got the grace of %d marks",5*sub);
            else
                printf("He didn't get any grace");
        break;

    }
}
