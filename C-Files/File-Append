C program to append the contents of one file at the end of another.


NOTE: Make two file as "FILE1.TXT" and "FILE2.TXT" in bin directory and then run the program. The contents of FILE1.TXT will be appended to FILE2.TXT.


#include<stdio.h>
#include<conio.h>
void main() {

FILE *f1,*f2;
char ch;

clrscr();

f1=fopen("FILE1.TXT","r");    /* file to append */
f2=fopen("FILE2.TXT","a+");   /* file to be appended */

if(f1==NULL || f2==NULL) {
printf("\ncannot open one of files!");

exit();
}

while(1) {

ch=fgetc(f1);

if(ch==EOF) {
break;
}

fputc(ch,f2);

}

fclose(f1);
fclose(f2);

printf("\ntask completed successfully!");

getch();

}
