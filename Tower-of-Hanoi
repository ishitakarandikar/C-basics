There are 3 pegs labeled A, B and C.Four disks are placed on peg A. The bottom-most disk is largest, and disks go on decreasing in size with the topmost disk being smallest.
The objective of the game is to move the disks from peg A to peg C, using peg B as an auxiliary peg.The rules of the game are as follows:

(1) Only one disk may be moved at a time, and it must be the top disk on one of the pegs.
(2) A larger disk should never be placed on the top of a smaller disk.

Write a program to print out the sequence in which the disks should be moved such that all disks on peg A are finally transferred to peg C.

#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

void hanoirecursion(int num,char ndl1, char ndl2, char ndl3)
{

    if(num == 1)
    {

    printf("Move top disk from needle %c to needle %c\n",ndl1,ndl2);
    return;

    }

hanoirecursion(num-1,ndl1,ndl3,ndl2);

printf("Move top disk from needle %c to needle %c\n",ndl1,ndl2);

hanoirecursion(num-1,ndl3,ndl2,ndl1);

}

int main()
{

    int no;

    printf("Enter the Number of Disks to be Transferred:\n\n");

    scanf("%d",&no);

if(no<1)
{

    printf("\n There is nothing to move:\n");

}
else
{

    printf("\n Recursive:\n");
    hanoirecursion(no,'A','B','C'); 

}

getch();

return 0;

}
