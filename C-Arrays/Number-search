Twenty-five numbers are entered from the keyboard into an array. The number to be searched is entered through the keyboard by the user.
Write a program to find if the number to be searched is present in the array and if it is present, display the number of times it appears in the array.

#include<stdio.h>
#include<conio.h>
int main()
{
	int arr[25], a, i, count = 0;
	for (i = 0; i<25; i++)
	{
		printf("Enter number : ");
		scanf("%d", &arr[i]);
	}
	printf("\n\nEnter the number you want to search : ");
	scanf("%d", &a);
	for (i = 0; i<25; i++)
	{
		if (arr[i] == a)
			count++;
	}
	if (count)
		printf("\n\n%d is present in the data %d times.", a, count);
	else
		printf("\n\n%d is not present in the data.", a);
	_getch();
	return 0;
}
